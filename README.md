The Odin Project : Foundations : Etch A Sketch Project
---

Date: 07/27/2023

**Overview:** This was the etch-a-sketch project from The Odin Project Foundations course.

For this project you had to create a dynamic etch-a-sketch board that changes based on the number the user inputted
ranging from 1-100.

**Future Improvements:** 
I'd go back and change the way I implemented the change grid size by including a slider instead of the button that
I went with.
